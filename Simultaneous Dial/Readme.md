This script plays a greeting when it receives a call then dials into several numbers of people who could take the call. Whoever answers the call first takes the call.

It then finishes with a redirect verb which can be used to direct the call to a voicemail script in case there was nobody available to take the call.

The call is also recorded for future inspection.

This type of call flow is typically used by a small office or call center that handles inbound calls with several agents available for taking calls.
