This is a collection of TeXML files that can serve as examples on how to do simple things with only xml files.

The advantage of a TeXML only solution is that it only needs a simple xml file on a web server that could be on any simple hosting (the same type that hosts any webpage) and does not need a complex server where services need to be run and maintained to be executing scripts or the like.
