This is a simple TeXML script that gives users 2 different options when dialed.

The typical scenario for this is to give callers options to choose to be attended in two different languages.

If the caller presses any digit it gets connected to the Agent that speaks English.
If the caller does nothing on the call it gets connected to the Agent that speaks Spanish.

On either case the call is sent to a second TeXML script which asks the caller to wait while the call is being attended in the selected language they previously chose and then forwards the call to a pre-specified number.
